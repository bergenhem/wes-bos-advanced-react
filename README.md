# Fullstack Advanced React & GraphQL Course - 2025 Update

Code repository I'm using while following the [Advanced React course by Wes Bos](https://advancedreact.com/).

Using this course as a way to regain familiarity with React and Next.js while using [Zed](https://zed.dev/) as the main IDE.

## Notable updates:
- All npm packages should be up-to-date as of September 2025
- Updated Keystone.js to v6 which has a different API
- I'm using SQLite instead of MongoDB Atlas (Keystone.js v6 [does not support MongoDB at the moment](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/discussions/7511))
